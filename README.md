# Analyzing Students' Mental Health

![Mental Health](mentalhealth.jpg)

Utilized SQL to analyze and explore whether length of stay affects mental health scores for international students at a Japanese university.

## About

This project used SQL to analyze survey data from international students, looking at:
- Depression scores (PHQ-9)
- Social connectedness scores (SCS)
- Acculturative stress scores (ASISS)

## Key Finding

Longer-staying international students report higher acculturative stress, while depression scores remain relatively stable. Sample sizes for students staying 5+ years are too small to draw conclusions.

## Data

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `stay` | Length of stay in years |
| `todep` | Depression score |
| `tosc` | Social connectedness score |
| `toas` | Acculturative stress score |

## Tools Used

- PostgreSQL
- DataCamp Workspace
